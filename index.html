            <h1 ><u>The Beagle Blog</u></h1>

            <p >The <b><i>Beagle</i></b> is a breed of small scent hound, similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound. 
            The <b><i>beagle</i></b> was developed primarily for hunting hare, known as beagling. Possessing a great sense of smell
            and superior tracking instincts, the <b><i>beagle</i></b> is the primary breed used as detection dog for prohibited 
            agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The <b><i>beagle</i></b> is intelligent and is a 
            popular pet due to it's size, good temper, and a lack of inherited health problems.</p>
